# Install a multisite environment

In order to work correctly, the plugin must be installed within a multisite environment with more than one blog, each blog being set in a different language. This specific WordPress installation is described in details in the article [Create a Network \(WP Codex\)](http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network) in which you can also find more information on that topic.
