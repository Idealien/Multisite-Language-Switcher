# Editing association of posts

On the pages and posts edition screen, a new **Multisite Language Switcher** feature has appeared at the top left, in the side bar of existing pages or posts \(thus it is displayed after the first « Save » of a page/post\).

The scroll menu next to each flag shows the pages or posts titles. All you have to do is to choose the corresponding translation and to click on « Update ». This association between one page or post of one blog and another page or post belonging to another blog is automatically updated on the other blog too.
