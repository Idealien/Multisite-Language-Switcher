# Editing association of contents

## Connect post types
 
On the pages, posts and custom post types edition screen, a new **Multisite Language Switcher** feature has appeared at the top left, in the side bar of existing pages or posts (thus it is displayed after the first « Save » of a page/post).

The scroll menu next to each flag shows the pages or posts titles. All you have to do is to choose the corresponding translation and to click on « Update ».

This association between one page or post of one blog and another page or post belonging to another blog is automatically updated on the other blog too.

## Connect taxonomies

You can connect also categories, tags and custom taxonomies in their respective edit pages.

## Status of connections

You can see the status of the connections in every table-like output of available contents.

An "Add link"-icon (green plus) shows that there is no connection set. The "Edit link"-icon (yellow pencil) shows that there is a connection in place.
